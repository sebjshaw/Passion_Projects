# Passion Projects 

## ATP Historical

Looks at historical data of every atp match for each year. Have access to every year 
going back a long time but starting only with the most recent years. Lots of data and 
the intention is to create a table and an API to query the table.

## Fantasy Tennis 

Aims to calculate the points won by a specified team of 10 players each week. Will involve 
web scraping and a MySQL table to store the running total of players. Motivation for this 
project is to make my life easier when calculating my teams points every week.
